## Welcome to Xinyue (Moon) Liang's machine learning project page. ##
 
 I am a student who currently study in the Quantitative Methods of Social Sciences program of Columbia University. 
 As a student in the program, I have acquired the knowledge of Python, basic R, statistics, data analysis using regression models and machine learning using datasets. 
 This page provides several demonstrations of the projects that I have done of Machine Learning
 
 ### First: U.N. World Happiness Report ###
 Used Random forest classifier with GridResearchCV, Gradient boosting classifier, and Neural Network to find model that best predict world happiness and found Gradient boosting classifier to be the best model out of all. 
 
 ### Second: Covid positive rate prediction using X-ray image data ###
 Tried VGG 16, Neural Networks, CNN models with different parameters and augmented data and found the best model is the CNN model with 10 conventional layers .
